# BOT & CMD Menu Plus for CS16Client Android
The goal of this repository i've created is to contribute CS16Client and Xash3D projects.
# Installation
- Download the latest .pak file from Releases section.
- Put the .pak file to your game data folder. (Ex: /sdcard/xash/cstrike)
- Launch the game.
- Check the botmenu and cmdmenu buttons in your touch config.
- If you don't have them, create two buttons then specify the button commands with:
- For the first button `exec touch/cmd/cmd`, second button `exec touch/bots/bots`
# If the menu doesn't work
- Check the other .pak files in the same folder. Some .pak files can overlap if they uses the same named files in the same directories. if there's more, remove them out of it then launch the game again.
- Check the touch folder and .cfg files in it, because this menu uses buy config files. So you should remove them too.
- Try to create a new folder named "custom" in the same folder then move the .pak file into it (This method is recommended)
- Still same? Maybe you should check the path (which configs, game saves, etc. are stored) in the Xash3D App.
